# svg-image-slider

This is about a really nice and fancy idea to create an animated image slider.
The code was taken from [codyhouse](http://codyhouse.co/gem/animated-svg-image-slider/)

You can see a live demo here: [http://codyhouse.co/demo/animated-svg-image-slider/index.html]

This is a little playground where I try to remove jQuery and maybe also snap.svg from the project to make it actually
usable in real live high performance web applications.
